In the past two decades, the pharmaceutical, personal care, and nutritional industries have converged to 
address growing demands in the beauty, health, and wellness market. This convergence has resulted in 
the formation of the new industry segments – Nutraceuticals, Cosmeceuticals and Nutricosmetics.

• Cosmeceuticals: topical cosmetic products that have medicinal or drug-like benefits (creams and
fortified syrups).
• Nutricosmetics: supplementation of nutrients that are formulated for beauty care (both oral and
topical).
• Nutraceuticals: products derived from food sources that provide extra health benefits, in 
addition to the basic nutritional value found in food (dietary supplements and functional food).

These three new segments are mainly driven by an increasing awareness and need for preventive 
healthcare, natural therapies, and anti-aging products. The annual global growth rate of all three 
segments is approximately 4%–8%. A noticeable geographical dominance is observed in different 
segments – China and Japan are key Nutricosmetic markets accounting for 90% of global sales, while the 
USA dominates the Nutraceutical category at approximately 45%.
